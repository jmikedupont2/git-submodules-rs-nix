## Memeification as the Argument of Knowledge

This concept posits that knowledge, particularly within complex systems and abstract frameworks, can be understood and propagated through a process akin to 'memeification.' Just as memes in cultural contexts convey complex ideas in simplified, transmissible forms, so too can fundamental arguments or insights about a system be distilled into easily digestible and replicable units. These 'memes' of knowledge serve as arguments, allowing for rapid dissemination and intuitive understanding, even when the underlying formal proofs or derivations are highly complex or inaccessible. The validity and impact of knowledge, in this view, are tied to its capacity for effective memeification and subsequent propagation within a given intellectual ecosystem.
