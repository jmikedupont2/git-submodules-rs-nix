\section{The Primorial Base Sequence (Zos Seq)}
We define a base sequence, denoted as $\mathcal{P}$, consisting of the first eight prime numbers:
\[ \mathcal{P} = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7, p_8\} = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\} \]
Each element $p_i \in \mathcal{P}$ serves as a basis for defining the length of specific topological structures.
