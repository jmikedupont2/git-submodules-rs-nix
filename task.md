# Current Development Plan

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the project, focusing on the `submodule-collector` and its reporting capabilities.

## 1. Generate Comprehensive Submodule Report

The `submodule-collector` has been updated to improve error reporting. The next step is to run it to generate a comprehensive JSON report of all Git repositories and their submodules within the main project scope.

*   **Action:** Execute the `submodule-collector` from the appropriate root directory, ensuring the output JSON includes both successfully processed repositories and detailed information on any failures.
*   **Command (example):**
    ```bash
    ./target/release/submodule-collector --root-dir /data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/source/github/meta-introspector/ --output-file submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json
    ```
    *(Note: The `--root-dir` should point to the root of your meta-introspector project.)*

## 2. Develop Submodule Report Function (`report-analyzer-rs`)

A new reporting capability is required to analyze the generated JSON report. This function will extract key statistics and insights, and perform advanced string analysis.

*   **Objective:** Create a Rust-based mechanism (`report-analyzer-rs`) to read `submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json` and provide:
    *   Counts of successful vs. failed repositories.
    *   Identification of duplicate repository entries.
    *   Analysis of most frequently mentioned organizations (from repository URLs).
    *   Analysis of most frequently mentioned names or strings (e.g., submodule names, repository names).
    *   Analysis of top N-grams for various sizes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).
    *   Identification of the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) among all paths and URLs for conceptual compression.
*   **Implementation Approach:** Implemented as a standalone Rust binary (`report-analyzer-rs`).

## 3. Document Changes (CRQ & README)

Formalize the recent development efforts and the plan for the reporting function.

*   **Action (CRQ):** Create `docs/crq/CRQ-002-submodule-report-function.md` outlining the task of developing the submodule report function, its objectives, and expected outcomes.
*   **Action (README):** Update the project's `README.md` to reflect the enhanced `submodule-collector` capabilities and the new `report-analyzer-rs` features.

## 4. Next Steps: Advanced String Analysis and Compression

The next phase focuses on refining the string analysis and implementing a conceptual compression scheme.

*   **4.1. Generalized N-gram Analysis (Complete)**
    *   **Objective:** Extend `report-analyzer-rs` to generate and analyze N-grams for specified sizes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).
    *   **Status:** Implemented and verified.

*   **4.2. Conceptual "Compression" and Emoji Ontology**
    *   **Objective:** Create a new compressed version of the JSON output, inspired by linked data principles (like Turtle/JSON-LD), using emoji keys for common strings/prefixes to represent an "ontology".
    *   **Sub-tasks:**
        *   **Identify Common Strings and Prefixes:** Develop a method to identify a comprehensive set of most frequent tokens and common prefixes/paths beyond just the LCP.
        *   **Develop Emoji Ontology:** Assign meaningful emojis to these identified common strings/concepts. This mapping will serve as a simple ontology.
        *   **Generate "Compressed" JSON Output:**
            *   Define a custom JSON output structure.
            *   Include a "header" section in the JSON that defines the emoji-based ontology (mapping emojis to their corresponding full strings/prefixes).
            *   Modify the main data section to use these emoji "keys" to shorten the original URLs and paths, effectively compressing the output.
