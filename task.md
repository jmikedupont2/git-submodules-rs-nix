# Next Steps

Based on the current project documentation and Git status, here are the proposed next steps:

## 1. Commit Pending Changes

The repository has modifications related to the `naersk` submodule and associated Nix/Rust configuration files. It's important to commit these changes to bring the repository to a consistent state.

*   **Action**: Stage and commit the modified `.gitmodules`, the new `naersk` submodule, and the changes in `Cargo.toml`, `flake.lock`, `flake.nix`, and `rust-toolchain.toml`.

## 2. Verify Git Submodule Health

After committing the submodule-related changes, it's crucial to ensure the submodules are correctly configured and in a healthy state, aligning with the objectives of **CRQ-007: Git Submodules Reconciliation and Health Check**.

*   **Action**: Run `git submodule status` to verify the state of all submodules. If a more comprehensive tool for submodule health checks exists (as envisioned in CRQ-007), consider utilizing it.

## 3. Continue Development on Core CRQs

The current changes likely contribute to the broader goals outlined in the Change Requests. Focus should remain on advancing the foundational CRQs.

*   **Focus Area 1: Project Context Introspector (CRQ-003)**: This is identified as a critical enabler for many other CRQs. Continue development on its architecture and data ingestion capabilities as outlined in `docs/design/context_introspector_architecture.md`.
*   **Focus Area 2: Automate SOP Steps into Rust Programs (CRQ-002)**: Leverage the updated Nix/Rust environment to begin automating operational steps from existing SOPs into executable Rust programs. This will directly utilize the `gitoxide`, `submod`, and `magoo` submodules.

## 4. Review Untracked Files

There are several untracked files (`generate-lock.nix`, `result`, `shell.nix`, `src/bin/`, `tools/`). Determine if these should be added to version control, ignored, or are temporary artifacts.

*   **Action**: Review the purpose of these untracked files and decide on appropriate action (add to `.gitignore`, add to repository, or remove if temporary).
