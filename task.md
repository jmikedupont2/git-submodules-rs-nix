# Current Development Plan

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the project, focusing on the `submodule-collector` and its reporting capabilities.

## 1. Generate Comprehensive Submodule Report

The `submodule-collector` has been updated to improve error reporting. The next step is to run it to generate a comprehensive JSON report of all Git repositories and their submodules within the main project scope.

*   **Action:** Execute the `submodule-collector` from the appropriate root directory, ensuring the output JSON includes both successfully processed repositories and detailed information on any failures.
*   **Command (example):**
    ```bash
    /nix/store/cprwxaxn2fb151r7lsnqd0djrdf7p621-submodule-collector-0.1.0/bin/submodule-collector --root-dir ../../../ --output-file /data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/source/github/meta-introspector/submodules/submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json
    ```
    *(Note: The exact path to `submodule-collector` may vary after rebuilds.)*

## 2. Develop Submodule Report Function

A new reporting capability is required to analyze the generated JSON report. This function will extract key statistics and insights.

*   **Objective:** Create a mechanism to read `submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json` and provide:
    *   Counts of successful vs. failed repositories.
    *   Identification of duplicate repository entries.
    *   Analysis of most frequently mentioned organizations (from repository URLs).
    *   Analysis of most frequently mentioned names or strings (e.g., submodule names, repository names).
*   **Implementation Approach:** This can be implemented as a new Rust binary, a subcommand to `submodule-collector`, or a Python script that parses the JSON. For immediate interactive use, a Python script or direct parsing within the agent is feasible.

## 3. Document Changes (CRQ & README)

Formalize the recent debugging efforts and the plan for the reporting function.

*   **Action (CRQ):** Create a new CRQ document outlining the task of developing the submodule report function, its objectives, and expected outcomes.
*   **Action (README):** Update the project's `README.md` to reflect the enhanced `submodule-collector` capabilities and the new reporting feature.
