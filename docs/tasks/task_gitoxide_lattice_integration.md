# Task: Integrate `gitoxide` into Lattice System

## Submodule Details

*   **Name:** `gitoxide`
*   **Path:** `gitoxide/` (relative to project root)
*   **Purpose:** A pure Rust, idiomatic, and fast implementation of Git. It provides low-level access to Git objects and operations.
*   **Key Files/Directories:**
    *   `gix/`: Main library crate.
    *   `gix-object/`: Git object model.
    *   `gix-ref/`: Git references.
    *   `src/`: Source code for various components.

## Knowledge for AI

*   **Relevance to Lattice:** `gitoxide` is a fundamental dependency for Git operations within the project. Understanding its structure and functionalities is key to analyzing how Git data is handled.
*   **Data Points for Extraction:**
    *   Git object types (blob, tree, commit, tag).
    *   Reference types (branches, tags, remotes).
    *   Low-level Git operations (parsing, writing, traversing).
    *   Performance characteristics (if available).
*   **Potential Predicates:** `git-implementation`, `rust-library`, `low-level-git`, `data-structures`, `performance-critical`.
*   **Integration Goal:** The AI should be able to map Git concepts and operations within the project to their underlying `gitoxide` implementations. It should identify patterns in how Git data is accessed and manipulated.
