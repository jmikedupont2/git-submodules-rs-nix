# Task: Integrate `naersk` into Lattice System

## Submodule Details

*   **Name:** `naersk`
*   **Path:** `naersk/` (relative to project root)
*   **Purpose:** A Nix-based build system for Rust projects, simplifying dependency management and cross-compilation.
*   **Key Files/Directories:**
    *   `default.nix`: Main Nix expression for building Rust projects.
    *   `lib/`: Contains Nix utility functions.
    *   `flake.nix`: (If present) Nix flake definition.

## Knowledge for AI

*   **Relevance to Lattice:** `naersk` is critical for understanding the project's build and dependency management strategy, especially for Rust components within the Nix ecosystem.
*   **Data Points for Extraction:**
    *   Rust project definitions within Nix.
    *   Dependency resolution mechanisms.
    *   Build phases and outputs.
    *   Cross-compilation configurations.
*   **Potential Predicates:** `nix-build`, `rust-build`, `dependency-management`, `cross-compilation`, `build-system`.
*   **Integration Goal:** The AI should analyze `naersk` to understand how Rust projects are built and managed within the Nix environment. It should identify build dependencies, build artifacts, and potential build optimizations.
