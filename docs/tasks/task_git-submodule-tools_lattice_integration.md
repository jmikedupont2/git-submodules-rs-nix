# Task: Integrate `git-submodule-tools` into Lattice System

## Submodule Details

*   **Name:** `git-submodule-tools`
*   **Path:** `git-submodule-tools/` (relative to project root)
*   **Purpose:** A collection of tools for managing Git submodules. Contains shell scripts, tests, and potentially some documentation.
*   **Key Files/Directories:**
    *   `bin/`: Contains executable scripts.
    *   `tests.sh`: Test suite for the tools.
    *   `README.md`: General information about the tools.

## Knowledge for AI

*   **Relevance to Lattice:** This submodule is crucial for understanding how submodules are managed in the project. Its scripts and tests provide operational knowledge.
*   **Data Points for Extraction:**
    *   Script names and their functionalities.
    *   Test cases and their coverage.
    *   Any configuration files or patterns used by the tools.
*   **Potential Predicates:** `git-management`, `submodule-utility`, `shell-script`, `testing-tool`.
*   **Integration Goal:** The AI should understand the operational aspects of submodule management within the project by analyzing this submodule. It should be able to identify common submodule operations and their implementations.
