# Task: Integrate `submod` into Lattice System

## Submodule Details

*   **Name:** `submod`
*   **Path:** `submod/` (relative to project root)
*   **Purpose:** (Purpose of submod is unknown without further inspection. Placeholder for now.)
*   **Key Files/Directories:** (Key files/directories of submod are unknown without further inspection. Placeholder for now.)

## Knowledge for AI

*   **Relevance to Lattice:** (Relevance of submod to lattice is unknown. Placeholder for now.)
*   **Data Points for Extraction:** (Data points for submod are unknown. Placeholder for now.)
*   **Potential Predicates:** (Potential predicates for submod are unknown. Placeholder for now.)
*   **Integration Goal:** The AI should analyze the `submod` submodule to determine its purpose, key functionalities, and how it contributes to the overall project. It should then propose relevant predicates and integration strategies for the lattice system.
